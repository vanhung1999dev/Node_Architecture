# What is Promise

- A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value

## The Lifecycle of a Promise:

- Pending: The initial state, where the asynchronous operation is still running.
- Resolved (Fulfilled): The state when the asynchronous operation completes successfully.
- Rejected: The state when the asynchronous operation fails.

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  if (operationSuccess) {
    resolve("Success!"); // Settles the promise to the resolved state
  } else {
    reject("Failure!"); // Settles the promise to the rejected state
  }
});
```

## Microtasks and the Event Loop:

- When a Promise is resolved or rejected, **it doesn‚Äôt immediately execute the then() or catch() methods**. Instead, it **schedules the execution of those handlers in the microtask queue (a queue for small tasks that should be executed after the currently executing script, but before rendering and other tasks)**.

## Promise Internals:

A Promise object typically contains the following: <br>

- **State**: Stores the current state (pending, fulfilled, rejected).
- **Result**: Stores the resolved value or the rejection reason.
- **Handlers**: Arrays for .then() and .catch() callbacks that are queued to execute once the Promise settles.

## Promise Resolution and Chaining:

- When a Promise is resolved, it triggers the .then() method on it, and when rejected, it triggers .catch(). These methods return new Promises, which allows chaining:

```js
promise
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // "Success!"
    return "Next step"; // Returns a new Promise (or value)
  })
  .then((nextValue) => {
    console.log(nextValue); // "Next step"
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Handles errors from any previous promise
  });
```

- Create a new Promise and attach the provided handlers (callbacks) to it.
- The handlers are invoked when the original Promise is settled.
- If the handler returns a value (non-Promise), it‚Äôs automatically wrapped in a resolved Promise.
- If the handler throws an error, the returned Promise is rejected.

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then((val) => {
    console.log("Step 1:", val);
    return val + 1;
  })
  .then((val) => {
    console.log("Step 2:", val);
    return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(val + 1), 100));
  })
  .then((val) => {
    console.log("Step 3:", val);
  });
```

### üîç What happens under the hood?

#### Step 1: Promise.resolve(1)

- Creates a resolved Promise with value 1.

#### üî∏ Step 2: .then(callback)

When you call .then() on a Promise: <br>

- A new Promise is created and returned.
- The callback you pass is registered to run when the original Promise is fulfilled.
- That callback is scheduled into the microtask queue. <br>

```js
const p2 = p1.then(fn);
```

Is functionally: <br>

```js
const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // When p1 settles...
  p1.onFulfilled = (val) => {
    try {
      const result = fn(val); // run your .then callback
      resolve(result); // resolve p2 with the return value
    } catch (err) {
      reject(err); // reject p2 if error happens
    }
  };
});
```

- So each .then() returns a new Promise linked to the previous one.

#### üí° Important Internals:

- If fn() returns a value ‚Üí the next Promise is resolved with that value.
- If fn() returns a Promise ‚Üí the next Promise "follows" it ‚Äî it waits for that inner Promise to resolve.
- If fn() throws an error ‚Üí the next Promise is rejected.

### üîÑ Visual Model of the Chain:

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then((val) => {
    // creates promise P1
    return val + 1; // resolves P2
  })
  .then((val) => {
    // creates promise P2
    return new Promise((res) => setTimeout(() => res(val + 1), 100)); // async op
  })
  .then((val) => {
    // creates promise P3
    console.log(val); // outputs 3
  });
```

‚è≥ Behind the scenes: <br>

- Each .then() returns a new Promise.
- Each new Promise has its own microtask.
- If a .then() returns a Promise, it waits for that inner Promise to resolve.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistake ‚Äî Not Returning in Chain

```js
Promise.resolve(1)
  .then((val) => {
    console.log("step 1");
    new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(val + 1), 100));
  })
  .then((val) => {
    console.log("step 2", val); // val is undefined!
  });
```

Why? Because we didn‚Äôt return the inner Promise, so the chain doesn‚Äôt wait! <br>
‚úÖ Fix: <br>

```js
.then((val) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(val + 1), 100));
})

```

## üì¶ 1. Does Each Promise Have Its Own Queue?

- Yes, internally each Promise object maintains its own reaction queue.

```js
const p = Promise.resolve(42);
p.then((x) => console.log("A", x));
p.then((x) => console.log("B", x));
```

- This creates two reactions on p. So p internally maintains a list like:

```js
[[PromiseFulfillReactions]]: [
  reactionJobFor("A"),
  reactionJobFor("B")
]

```

## üßæ How .then() Works Internally

```js
const p = new Promise((resolve) => resolve(1));
p.then((val) => console.log("1", val));
```

Here's the internal logic of .then(): <br>

```js
function then(onFulfilled) {
  const reactionRecord = {
    type: "fulfill",
    handler: onFulfilled,
    capability: newPromiseCapability()
  };

  if (this.[[PromiseState]] === "pending") {
    this.[[PromiseFulfillReactions]].push(reactionRecord);
  } else if (this.[[PromiseState]] === "fulfilled") {
    queueMicrotask(() => {
      try {
        const result = reactionRecord.handler(this.[[PromiseResult]]);
        reactionRecord.capability.resolve(result);
      } catch (e) {
        reactionRecord.capability.reject(e);
      }
    });
  }

  return reactionRecord.capability.promise;
}

```

- This means .then() doesn‚Äôt immediately execute. It creates a new promise reaction record and either queues it (pending) or runs it in a microtask (already resolved).

## üîÅ How Promise Chaining Works

```js
Promise.resolve("a")
  .then((x) => x + "b")
  .then((x) => x + "c")
  .then(console.log);
```

### Internal Flow:

Each **.then()** call: <br>

- Creates a new promise (let‚Äôs say p2, p3, ‚Ä¶).
- Registers a handler to the previous promise‚Äôs queue.
- When the previous promise resolves:
  - Its .then() handler runs in a microtask.
  - The return value of the handler resolves the next promise.

### Chaining

```js
Promise (value: "a")
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ then (x => x + "b") ‚Üí Promise (value: "ab")
          ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ then (x => x + "c") ‚Üí Promise (value: "abc")
                 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ then (console.log)

```

- Each .then() adds a reaction that feeds into the next promise in the chain.

## How Microqueue is Used in the Chain

```js
Promise.resolve("a")
  .then((x) => {
    console.log("Step 1", x);
    return x + "b";
  })
  .then((x) => {
    console.log("Step 2", x);
    return x + "c";
  });
```

### Execution

- 1.JS starts: resolves initial promise ‚Üí queues then callback to microtask queue.
- 2. Event loop:
  - Finishes current script.
  - Runs microtask queue in order:
    - Step 1 runs ‚Üí returns "ab"
    - Step 2 gets scheduled with "ab" ‚Üí runs ‚Üí returns "abc"

So, the entire chain is broken down into a sequence of microtasks. <br>

## Behind the Curtain ‚Äì Microtask Execution Lifecycle

```js
const p1 = Promise.resolve("foo");

const p2 = p1.then((val) => {
  console.log("A", val);
  return val + "bar";
});

p2.then((val) => {
  console.log("B", val);
});
```

- Promises are JS objects with internal PromiseReaction queues.
- A queue flush triggers a PromiseReactionJob.
- These jobs are stored in V8‚Äôs Isolate-level microtask queue (one per thread).
- When V8 finishes executing JS stack, it runs all queued microtasks before processing the next event.
