# ♻️ V8 Heap Memory: Young Generation – Deep Dive with Diagrams

---

## 📦 What is the Young Generation in V8?

In V8 (used by Chrome and Node.js), the heap is split into two parts:

- **Young Generation** – for short-lived objects
- **Old Generation** – for long-lived objects

We will now **focus only on the Young Generation**.

---

# 👶 Young Generation (New Space) – Deep Dive

### 🔸 Purpose:

- Stores **newly created objects**
- Designed for **short-lived** data
- Small size (typically 1–8MB)

### 🔸 Structure: Semi-space Model

```
Young Generation (New Space)
+--------------------------+
| From-Space (active)     |
| To-Space   (inactive)   |
+--------------------------+
```

- From-Space: where allocations happen
- To-Space: used during GC to copy live data

---

# 🔄 Minor GC (Scavenge) – Step by Step

### 🧱 Step 1: Allocation

```js
let a = { name: "foo" }; // Allocated in From-Space
let b = { count: 123 }; // Also allocated in From-Space
```

### 📦 Diagram:

```
From-Space:
+-------------------------+
| Object A: {name: "foo"} |
| Object B: {count: 123}  |
+-------------------------+
```

### 🧱 Step 2: From-Space gets full

- When new allocations can’t fit
- V8 triggers **Minor GC**

### 📦 Diagram:

```
From-Space FULL:
+-------------------------+
| Object A               |
| Object B               |
| Object C ← fails!      | ← triggers GC
+-------------------------+
```

# ❄️ Stop-the-World (STW) – Minor GC Pausing

During Minor GC, V8 performs a **Stop-the-World (STW)** pause:

### ❗ What Happens:

- JavaScript **execution stops completely**
- The **main thread is paused**
- V8 performs garbage collection safely

### ⏱ Duration:

- Minor GCs are **very fast** (typically <1ms)
- So STW pauses are brief and frequent

### 📌 Key Benefit:

- Simplicity and speed in scanning memory with no mutations

### 🧠 Memory State:

```
[JS running]    → allocates until full
[GC Triggered]  → Stop-the-World begins
[GC Running]    → Live objects copied to To-Space
[GC Ends]       → Swap spaces, resume JS
```

# 🧠 How V8 Optimizes Minor GC with Worker Threads

Even though Minor GC includes a Stop-the-World pause, V8 applies **parallelization** and **concurrency** to reduce pause duration:

## 🧵 Multi-Threaded Parallel GC

- V8 uses **multiple threads** to perform the copying of live objects in **parallel**.
- These threads (called **GC workers**) help offload copying and tracing from the main thread.

### 🚀 Workflow:

1. Main thread triggers GC
2. Worker threads are spawned or reused from a GC thread pool
3. Root objects and remembered sets are partitioned
4. Each worker processes a section of memory concurrently
5. Final steps (e.g. To-Space swap) are done on main thread

### 🧩 Diagram:

```
         [Main JS Thread] ⏸
               ↓
        ┌──────────────┐
        │    GC Task    │
        └──────────────┘
            ↙      ↘
 [Worker 1]        [Worker 2]
     ↓                  ↓
Copy & trace       Copy & trace
  live objs         live objs
```

## 🧠 Incremental GC (For Old Gen, but aids integration)

Although Minor GC is copying-based, V8’s general GC pipeline is **incremental** to avoid long STW.

- V8 schedules small GC tasks (marking, sweeping) during idle moments.
- Uses **task queues** and **priority scheduling** to ensure responsiveness.

---

# 🧹 Step 3: Minor GC Process

1. V8 **pauses JS execution** (STW)
2. It identifies **roots** (global variables, stack)
3. Traverses and marks **live** objects
4. **Copies** them to **To-Space**
5. **Dead** objects are left behind (reclaimed)
6. **Swaps** To-Space → From-Space

### 🔄 Example Code:

```js
let keep = { age: 30 }; // survives
function alloc() {
  let temp = { tmp: true }; // dies after function ends
}
alloc();
```

### 🧠 GC Trace:

- `keep` is global → live
- `temp` is temporary → dead

### 🧠 Memory Visualization:

```
[Before GC]
From-Space:
+---------------------------+
| keep → { age: 30 }       |
| temp → { tmp: true }     |
+---------------------------+

[During GC (STW)]
To-Space:
+---------------------------+
| { age: 30 } (copied)      |
+---------------------------+

[After GC Swap]
From-Space (new):
+---------------------------+
| { age: 30 }               |
+---------------------------+
To-Space (now empty)
```

# 🔁 Object Promotion: "Survives 2 Minor GCs"

Each time an object survives a GC, V8 increments a **survival counter**. If an object survives **2 Minor GCs**, it's promoted to the **Old Generation**.

### 📈 Promotion Timeline:

```
GC1 → survives once → copied
GC2 → survives again → promoted to Old Gen
```

# ✅ Pros and ❌ Cons of Young Gen GC

| ✅ Pros                        | ❌ Cons                               |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| ⚡ Extremely fast (copying GC) | 🔁 Overhead of copying live objects   |
| 💡 Simple two-space strategy   | 🧠 Needs precise root scanning        |
| 🧠 Efficient for temp data     | 🚫 Stop-the-World pause still happens |
| 🚀 Multithreaded GC workers    |                                       |

# 📌 Summary

- The Young Generation is optimized for **short-lived** objects
- Uses a **semi-space copying algorithm** with From-/To-Space
- **Minor GC** is fast but does **Stop-the-World** briefly
- V8 uses **GC worker threads** to run copy tasks in parallel
- Survivors are promoted after 2 GCs to the Old Generation
